## 'Capstone project 2: Choose Your Own' - Alicia Alfonso ##

# I. Introduction

# Daphniids are small crustaceans that live in freshwater ecosystems. Like
# many aquatic invertebrates, their body is composed of calcium (Ca) and
# their survival likely depends on the availability of this element in the
# water. The dataset used for this project are simplified results from a
# personal experiment (Alfonso, A. 2018 unpublished). The aim of the
# experiment was to assess the inter-clonal variation between two
# populations/clones (Northern and Southern) at different Ca
# concentrations (Ca 0.5 mg/l, 4 mg/l and 106 mg/l) and temperatures (15
# and 25ÂºC). With this information, we will create a model to predict the
# survival of Daphniids evaluating the effect of the different variables
# measured.

# V. Conclusion
# Modelling survival of organisms can give us a deep insight into which
# factors contribute to their success in an ecosystem. Using R for this
# purpose proves extremely useful and practical as we are able to generate
# predictions from smaller datasets. In our case, we establish the strong
# negative effect that low calcium concentrations have in the survival of
# Daphniids. We can conclude that the mortality will highly increase if
# there is a depletion of this element and that northern populations will
# be the most affected. Our model also hints towards strong interactions
# between variables that leads to more interesting questions regarding
# phenotypic plasticity or even toxicity for even higher calcium
# concentrations.
